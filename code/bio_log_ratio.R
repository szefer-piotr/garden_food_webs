# Data analysis ----
## 1. Log response ratios ----

# Direct and indirect effects on plants can be calculated using the log ratio. ln(Vp+/Vp-) where V's are community variables (herbivore abundance and plant biomass in the presence and absence of herbivores). These effect magnitudes can be plotted in relation to each other on an x-y plane and in relation to a 45 deg reference line tha represents the equivalence in strength of direct and indirect effect of carnivores.

# The log ratio effect of carnivores on herbivores should always be negative if carnivores are limiting herbivores regardles of the of the way herbivores are resource limited.
# page 36 Resloving ecosystem complexity

# I need biomass of herbivores, arthropod predators and plant for each plot.

# Inspect that and see if there are any changes in the food web structure. What can i expect?
