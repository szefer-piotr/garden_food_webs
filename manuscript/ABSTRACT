1. Successional theory emphasizes plant performance and competitive ability as key drivers of early successional dynamics, in contrast to top-down biotic factors maintaining plant diversity in mature tropical forests.
2. Here we are testing, for the first time, the effects of food web interactions on the early successional dynamics of a lowland tropical forest in Papua New Guinea. On 36 vegetation plots ($25 m^2$) we experimentally manipulated insect herbivores, fungal pathogens and predators on replicated $5 \times 5 m$ successional plots using broad spectrum insecticides, fungicides, predator exclosures and herbivore introductions.
3. Experimental food web manipulations had complex effects on the plant community during one year of succession. Herbivorous insects {>>always talk about the effect of a factor and not of a treatment<<} increased plant community complexity, and cased higer richness of {>>see what the main results are<<} of woody plants. Fungi increased species richness and abundance of woody plant communities. We also found evidence for the top-down effects of predators, but only on the evenness of woody plant communities. Insect herbivores and predators, but not fungi, also increased the predictability of successional trajectories in plant communities.  
4. Synthesis. Food webs have clear but complicated impact on the direction and predictability of the early secondary successional trajectories in rainforest ecosystems. Diverse modes of action of individual biotic factors (pathogens, herbivores and their predators) complement each other and affect different aspects of the woody plant community, generally contributing to high plant diversity in the early succession.
